some people use *etckeeper* to trace the chnages in /etc/, so that inspired me
to track my .vim/ with git

Now I know how to mv my .vimrc into .vim/ to do version control

    1. cp .vimrc .vim/vimrc, and now we can run "git add vimrc" inside .vim/
    2. open .vimrc
    3. run the command "ggdGa runtime vimrc", delete everything in .vimrc and add "runtime vimrc" 
    4. that is all

now I am start to edit this page by:

        :h peter-note
        :set ma " to make this page modifiable.
